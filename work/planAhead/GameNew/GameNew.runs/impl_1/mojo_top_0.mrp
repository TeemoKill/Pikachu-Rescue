  Number of Slice LUTs:                      1,604 out of   5,720   28%
    Number used as logic:                    1,600 out of   5,720   27%
      Number using O6 output only:           1,031
      Number using O5 output only:              48
      Number using O5 and O6:                  521
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,440    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      4
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         4
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       532 out of   2,860   18%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,625
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,429 out of   1,625   87%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  21 out of   1,625    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         175 out of   1,625   10%
    Number of unique control sets:              17
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             104 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        63 out of     102   61%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                       63 out of      63  100%
    IOB Flip Flops:                              7
